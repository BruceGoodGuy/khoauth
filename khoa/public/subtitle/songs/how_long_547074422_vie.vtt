00:00:04.216 --> 00:00:08.515
We don't talk anymore, we
don't talk anymore

1
00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:13.614
We don't talk anymore, like we
used to do

2
00:00:13.802 --> 00:00:15.601
We don't love anymore

3
00:00:15.807 --> 00:00:17.706
What was all of it for?

4
00:00:17.906 --> 00:00:23.105
Oh. we don't talk anymore.
like we used to do

5
00:00:23.299 --> 00:00:26.398
I just heard you found the one
you've been looking

6
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.399
You've been looking for

7
00:00:28.613 --> 00:00:32.412
I wish I would have known that wasn't me

8
00:00:32.614 --> 00:00:36.013
'Cause even after all this
time I still wonder

9
00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:38.108
Why I can't move on

10
00:00:38.308 --> 00:00:42.607
Just the way you did so easily

11
00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:43.808
Don't wanna know

12
00:00:43.906 --> 00:00:46.605
What kind of dress you're
wearing tonight

13
00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:49.018
If he's holding onto you so tight

14
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.609
The way I did before

15
00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:54.116
I overdosed

16
00:00:54.314 --> 00:00:56.313
Should've known your love was a game

17
00:00:56.503 --> 00:00:58.502
Now I can't get you out of my brain

18
00:00:58.712 --> 00:01:01.611
Oh. it's such a shame

19
00:01:01.817 --> 00:01:05.916
That we don't talk anymore. we
don't talk anymore

20
00:01:06.116 --> 00:01:10.715
We don't talk anymore. like we
used to do

21
00:01:10.901 --> 00:01:13.200
We don't love anymore

22
00:01:13.416 --> 00:01:15.615
What was all of it for?

23
00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:20.300
Oh. we don't talk anymore.
like we used to do

24
00:01:20.508 --> 00:01:23.807
I just hope you're lying next
to somebody

25
00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:26.216
Who knows how to love you like me

26
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.299
There must be a good reason
that you're gone

27
00:01:30.517 --> 00:01:32.616
Every now and then I think you

28
00:01:32.804 --> 00:01:35.703
Might want me to come show up
at your door

29
00:01:35.911 --> 00:01:39.610
But I'm just too afraid that
I'll be wrong

30
00:01:39.818 --> 00:01:42.117
Don't wanna know

31
00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:44.310
If you're looking into her eyes

32
00:01:44.514 --> 00:01:49.713
If she's holding onto you so
tight the way I did before

33
00:01:49.911 --> 00:01:51.710
I overdosed

34
00:01:51.918 --> 00:01:53.817
Should've known your love was a game

35
00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.108
Now I can't get you out of my brain

36
00:01:56.314 --> 00:01:59.013
Oh. it's such a shame

37
00:01:59.201 --> 00:02:01.600
That we don't talk anymore (We
don't. we don't)

38
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.709
We don't talk anymore (We
don't. we don't)

39
00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.608
We don't talk anymore. like we
used to do

40
00:02:07.814 --> 00:02:10.813
We don't love anymore (We
don't. we don't)

41
00:02:11.015 --> 00:02:13.214
What was all of it for? (We
don't. we don't)

42
00:02:13.404 --> 00:02:21.403
Oh. we don't talk anymore.
like we used to do

43
00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:35.308
Like we used to do

44
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.399
Don't wanna know

45
00:02:39.617 --> 00:02:41.716
What kind of dress you're
wearing tonight

46
00:02:41.914 --> 00:02:44.113
If he's giving it to you just right

47
00:02:44.305 --> 00:02:46.904
The way I did before

48
00:02:47.108 --> 00:02:48.807
I overdosed

49
00:02:49.005 --> 00:02:51.204
Should've known your love was a game

50
00:02:51.414 --> 00:02:53.613
Now I can't get you out of my brain

51
00:02:53.805 --> 00:02:56.004
Oh. it's such a shame

We don't talk anymore. like we
used to do

We don't love anymore (We
don't. we don't)

56
00:03:08.618 --> 00:03:10.417
What was all of it for? (We
don't. we don't)

Oh. we don't talk anymore.
like we used to do

What kind of dress you're
wearing tonight (Oh)

59
00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.608
If he's holding onto you so tight (Oh)
